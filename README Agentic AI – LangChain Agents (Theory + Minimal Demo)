# 🧠 Agentic AI – LangChain Agents (Minimal Demo)

This repository contains a **minimal working example of Agentic AI** using **LangChain Agents**.

It demonstrates how an AI system can:

* reason about a task,
* decide to use a tool,
* execute the tool,
* and produce a final answer.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside

* **Theory-first notebook** explaining Agentic AI
* **ReAct-based agent** with an explicit execution loop
* **Single tool use case** (multiplier) to clearly show decision-making
* **Secure API key handling** (no hardcoding)

---

## 🧠 Mental Model

```
User Input
 → LLM reasons
 → Agent selects action
 → AgentExecutor executes tool
 → Observation
 → Final Answer
```

**Agent decides.
Tool executes.
AgentExecutor runs the loop.**

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**
2. Add your OpenAI key in **Colab Secrets** as `OPENAI_KEY`
3. Run all cells top to bottom
