 # Agentic AI — Tool Calling (Function Calling)

This repository contains a **Google Colab notebook** demonstrating **Tool / Function Calling with LLMs** using OpenAI’s API.

The notebook shows how an LLM can **decide to call an external tool**, receive its output, and generate a final response — a core concept behind **Agentic AI systems**.

---

## What’s Inside

* Custom tool: `letter_counter`
* LLM decides **when** to use the tool
* Structured arguments passed to the tool
* Tool output returned to the LLM
* Final natural-language response generated

Example:

> *How many ‘r’s are in “Strawberry”?* → **3**

---

## Why This Matters

Tool calling enables LLMs to:

* Perform actions, not just generate text
* Orchestrate workflows
* Act as intelligent agents (LangChain, LangGraph, n8n patterns)
