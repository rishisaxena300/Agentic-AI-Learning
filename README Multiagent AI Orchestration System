# Multi-Agent AI Orchestration System

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent, event-driven AI orchestration workflow** focused on
architecture, routing, and execution reliability.

The goal was not prompt optimization, but understanding how **agentic systems behave in real workflows**.

## Problem Statement
Modern AI applications often fail not because of LLM capability, but due to:
- poor intent routing
- incorrect tool bindings
- brittle orchestration logic
- hardcoded execution paths

This project explores how to design a **robust agent orchestration layer** that can coordinate
multiple specialized agents reliably.

## What I Built
- Chat-triggered workflow
- Gatekeeper / context agent
- Manager agent for intent classification
- Switch-based routing
- Parallel specialist agents:
  - Google Calendar Agent
  - Weather Agent
  - Forex Agent
  - Secretary / Support Agent
- Merge + Summary agent for final response synthesis

## Key Observations & Fixes
- Most failures were caused by **incorrect tool contracts**, not LLM reasoning
- Explicitly guiding agents to invoke tools dramatically improved reliability
- Letting the model drive dynamic fields (instead of hardcoding) reduced failures
- Agent orchestration is a **systems design problem**, not a prompt problem

## Real Issues Faced
- Codespaces instability caused workflow execution failures
- n8n environment corruption required a full reinstall
- Python runner dependency issues led to redesigning the merge strategy using LLM summarization

## Takeaway
Agentic AI systems succeed or fail based on **orchestration design**:
routing, decision boundaries, tool contracts, and execution flow.

## Status
✔ Working multi-agent workflow  
✔ Real tools integrated  
✔ Designed for extensibility
